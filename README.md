# README: Concerns with PayPal for Small Payments and Introduction to Our Alternative Payment System

## Overview

This document aims to highlight significant concerns regarding PayPal’s handling of small payments based on user experiences and feedback. Additionally, we introduce a new small payment system that addresses these issues by leveraging past transaction records and smart contract-based refund policies.

## Key Issues with PayPal

### 1. Lack of Patience for Small Payments

PayPal appears to lack patience or interest in supporting small payments efficiently. This creates hurdles for small business owners and freelancers who rely on these transactions for their income.

### 2. Unusual Risk Strategies

Reports suggest that PayPal employs unusual and sometimes unreasonable risk strategies. These strategies can lead to abrupt account limitations without prior notice or a clear rationale, especially when user complaints arise.

**Example:**
User A reported that their account was limited after a small transaction was flagged as suspicious, despite providing proof of the transaction's legitimacy.

### 3. No Refund Opportunities for Merchants

In the event of a user complaint, PayPal often does not provide any opportunity for merchants to issue refunds or resolve the dispute amicably. Instead, accounts may face immediate suspension or bans.

**Example:**
Merchant B had their account frozen and couldn’t resolve a transaction dispute through refund, impacting their business operations.

### 4. High Revenue Threshold

When merchants start generating income, PayPal may impose requirements to increase their revenue to meet certain thresholds deemed acceptable by the platform. Failure to meet these undisclosed figures can result in discriminatory practices, including account closures.

**Example:**
Merchant C reported that their account faced restrictions due to low monthly revenue, eventually leading to account suspension.

### 5. Account Suspension without Explanation

Many users have reported account suspensions without receiving a clear reason or any justification from PayPal. This lack of transparency and arbitrary enforcement leaves users and merchants in difficult positions, affecting their financial stability.

## Our Small Payment System

To address the aforementioned issues, we are developing a new small payment system designed to provide a more efficient, transparent, and secure payment experience. This system eliminates the need for PayPal, leveraging past transaction records and smart contract-based refund policies.

### System Features

#### 1. **No Need for PayPal**

Our system operates independently of PayPal, allowing users and merchants to perform small transactions without high fees and complex procedures.

#### 2. **Based on Past Transaction Records**

We use past transaction records to evaluate the credibility of users and merchants, ensuring the safety and reliability of every transaction. This provides a trust mechanism that makes it easier for new users and merchants to enter the market.

#### 3. **Smart Contract Refund Policy**

Our system employs smart contract technology, enabling users to set up refundable transactions that can be terminated at any time. If an issue arises during the transaction, the smart contract will automatically execute the refund, removing the need for manual intervention.

### System Advantages

1. **Lower Fees**: Compared to traditional payment platforms, our system offers lower fees, making it particularly suitable for small payments and high-frequency transactions.
2. **Increased Transparency and Security**: Smart contracts and transaction records ensure transparency and security, reducing disputes and conflicts.
3. **Simplified User Experience**: Users and merchants can easily register and use our system without complex verification and procedures.

## Goals

While PayPal is widely used globally, it presents several challenges when handling small payments. By leveraging our new payment system, users and merchants can enjoy a more efficient, secure, and transparent payment experience. This document aims to highlight these issues and encourage users to consider alternative payment solutions that better meet their needs.
